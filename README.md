# Solidity Smart Contract

A simple Solidity smart contract for a token with minting and burning functionalities.

## Description

This project involves the creation of a basic token smart contract using Solidity. The contract includes functionalities for minting and burning tokens, tracking balances using a mapping, and storing public variables for the token's details. It's designed as an introductory example for understanding the basics of token creation and manipulation in the Ethereum blockchain environment.
